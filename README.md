Hangman Java Game

This Java project is an implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game allows players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. If the player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, it is revealed in its correct positions. If the letter is not in the word, an attempt is counted against the player. The game ends either when the player successfully guesses the word or exhausts all allowed attempts.
Features

    Random Word Selection: Words are loaded from a text file and a random word is selected for each game session.
    User Interaction: The game provides a command-line interface where users can input their guesses.
    Game State Display: The current state of the word, number of incorrect attempts, and the hangman drawing are displayed after each guess.
    Replayability: After the game ends, players are prompted to start a new game or quit.

How to Play

    Start the Game: Run the program to start the game.
    Guess Letters: Input letters one by one to guess the hidden word.
    Win or Lose: The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or make six incorrect guesses.
    Play Again: After the game ends, you can choose to start a new game or exit.
